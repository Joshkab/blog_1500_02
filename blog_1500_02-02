                I think that this article is really interesting because airports are really a staple in technological advancements. They teach the staff levels to better understand automation, which helps with the future of this emerging technnology. They have developed things like facial recognition, which was difficult for theh pandemic 
                I like how their new carbon engine design will result in fewer refeulling times.
